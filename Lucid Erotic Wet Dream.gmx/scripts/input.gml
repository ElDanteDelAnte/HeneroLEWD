This script will be designed to further simplify the controller system so as to eliminate
individual scripts in the obj_lainie and obj_gui objects.

It will store horizontal and vertical values, as well as booleans for key-downs,
on-off switches will be toggled, as well as either or switches, possible double-tap
detection can be implemented here
